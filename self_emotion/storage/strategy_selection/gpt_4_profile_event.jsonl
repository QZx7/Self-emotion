I'm sure he'll navigate his new challenges well, with or without the Tropical Sprite. \n\nfriend: I hope so. And thanks for putting things into perspective. How did you manage to overcome your anxiety, by the way?\n\nme: Honestly, a lot of practice and reminding myself that everyone in the audience is just a person too. And, a bit of humor goes a long way. Maybe that's something your nephew will learn too, especially if he decides to go into academia.\n\nfriend: Hopefully! And maybe I'll learn a thing or two about handling unexpected windfalls.
