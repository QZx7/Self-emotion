It\u2019s been hard, but I\u2019m taking steps.\n\nme: That's really courageous. If you ever need an ear or feel like sharing, I'm here. It\u2019s important we have someone to lean on, who understands the depth of our loss.\n\nThis approach aims to validate my friend's feelings, show empathy, share from my experiences without overshadowing his, and offer support, all while managing my feelings of jealousy in a manner that doesn't intrude on providing empathy and understanding."}
