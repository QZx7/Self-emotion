It's clear you care about her a lot, and it must be hard not being able to be there for her.\n\nfriend: Yeah, it is. I just wish I could do something to help.\n\nme: I'm sure she knows how much you care. Maybe giving her the space she needs is the best way to help her right now. But, it's also important to take care of yourself during this time. Have you thought about focusing on a hobby or hanging out with friends more? It might help distract you until things get better.\n\nfriend: That's a good point. Maybe I could spend some time working on my music more. It's been a while since I last played.\n\nme: That sounds like a fantastic idea. Your music could not only be a great outlet for you but also a beautiful way to express your feelings. Let's also plan to meet up soon, maybe grab a coffee or go for a walk. It'll be good to catch up.\n\nfriend: I'd like that. Thanks for being here for me.\n\nBy combining expressing care for his situation, encouraging him to maintain his individuality and focus on positive outlets during this challenging time, and suggesting activities that we could do together or he could do alone, the conversation supports my friend emotionally without pushing too hard against his girlfriend's current need for space."}
