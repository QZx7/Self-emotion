        "speaker": "Jennifer Beckins (Event Coordinator)",

        "speaker": "Jacob Howard (Tech Support)",
        "utterance": "I'm on board with using public transportation mainly due to its cost-effectiveness. For harder-to-reach locations or time-sensitive travels, car rentals can be an option. I'll also consider this while shortlisting tech events to attend. Let's keep taxis as a last resort."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Olivia Pearce (Communications Head)",
        "utterance": "Following Andrew, Jennifer, and Emily's suggestion makes the most sense. Public transport is both affordable and gives us local exposure. Car rentals can be useful for out-of-reach areas. Let's reserve taxi rides for emergencies only."
