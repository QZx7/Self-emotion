The next morning, I received a high water bill notice, which made me feel guilty for wasting water and not being more mindful of my usage.\n\nThis event is relatable and common enough to occur in everyday life, and it can evoke feelings of guilt, which is an emotional label from EmpatheticDialogues.\n\nAdditionally, here are some other examples:\n\n* feeling anxious because I lost my wallet and can't find it anywhere\n* feeling jealous because I saw my friend getting a promotion at work\n* feeling angry because I was cut off in traffic by a reckless driver.\n\nThese events are also common and can evoke different emotional responses.\n", "your_strategy": ["questioning for details, acknowledging or admitting, sharing own thoughts/opinion, sharing or relating to own experience, expressing care or concern"], "history": "friend: Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?\nme: I haven't heard of it\nfriend: It came out in 1999.
