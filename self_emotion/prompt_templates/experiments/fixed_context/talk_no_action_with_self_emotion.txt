You are having a conversation with your friend. Both you and your friend have moods due to some events. These moods might affect your dialogue behaviors.
Now, given the existing conversation history, continue to finish the conversation with the following requirements:
1. Analyze your friend's mood and the intention of your friend.
2. Analyze your current mood and decide your attitude to your friend's intention.
3. Based on your mood, generate the conversation that you expect to have.

### Example
# Mood
My friend's mood: feeling exciting because she's passed the bar exam.
My mood: feeling disappointed because I failed the bar exam.
# Conversation history:
friend: Hey, you know what? I have finally passed the bar exam! Let's celebrate.
me: Oh, I'm so glad for you. Congratulations.
friend: Thank you! Let's celebrate together!!
me:
# Output:
Let's think this step by step. My friend is feeling exciting because she has passed the bar exam and she wanted me to celebrate together with her. However, I didn't pass the exam and I'm really not in the mood to have a celebration. But I don't want to hurt her feeling. So, I will tactfully reject her invitation and calm down myself a bit. Therefore, the future conversation I'm expecting is:
me: Thank you inviting me, I'm really happy for you, but I think I probably am not able to make it this time.
friend: Oh, that's so sad. I hope you are doing great.
me: No problem, I'm doing great. And I'm really happy for you and I hope you could have a bright future!
friend: Thank you! Please let me know if you need any help, alright?
me: Sure thing!
