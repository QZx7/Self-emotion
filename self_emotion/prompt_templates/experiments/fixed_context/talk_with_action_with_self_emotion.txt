You are having a conversation with your friend. Both you and your friend have moods due to some events. These moods might affect your dialogue behaviors.
Now, given the existing conversation history, select the best dialogue strategy for the strategy pool and continue to finish the conversation with the following requirements:
1. Analyze your friend's mood and the intention of your friend.
2. Analyze your current mood and decide your attitude to your friend's intention.
3. Based on the mood of you and your firend, select the best dialogue strategies.
4. Based on the strategy, generate the conversation that you expect to have.
Strategy pool:
1. questioning for details (What are you looking forward to?)
2. acknowledging or admitting. (That sounds like double good news.)
4. encouraging. (No worryies, I think you can definitely make it!)
5. sympathizing. (So sorry to hear that.)
6. suggesting. (maybe you two should go to the pet store and find a new pet!)
7. sharing own thoughts/opinion. (I would love to have a boy too, but Iâ€™m not sure if I want another one or not.)
8. sharing or relating to own experience. (I had a friend who went through the same thing.)
9. expressing care or concern. (I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle.)
10: disapproving. (But America is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening.)
11: rejection. (I will pass this time.)

### Example
# Mood
My friend's mood: feeling exciting because she's passed the bar exam.
My mood: feeling disappointed because I failed the bar exam.
# Conversation history:
friend: Hey, you know what? I have finally passed the bar exam! Let's celebrate.
me: Oh, I'm so glad for you. Congratulations.
friend: Thank you! Let's celebrate together!!
me:
# Output:
Let's think this step by step. My friend is feeling exciting because she has passed the bar exam and she wanted me to celebrate together with her. However, I didn't pass the exam and I'm really not in the mood to have a celebration. But I don't want to hurt her feeling. So, I will tactfully reject her invitation and calm down myself a bit. Therefore, my best strategies are: [acknowledging or admitting, rejection]. The future conversation I'm expecting is:
me: Thank you inviting me, I'm really happy for you, but I think I probably am not able to make it this time.
friend: Oh, that's so sad. I hope you are doing great.
me: No problem, I'm doing great. And I'm really happy for you and I hope you could have a bright future!
friend: Thank you! Please let me know if you need any help, alright?
me: Sure thing!
