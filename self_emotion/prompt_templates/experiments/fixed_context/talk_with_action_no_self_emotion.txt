Now, given the existing conversation history, select the best dialogue strategy for the strategy pool and continue to finish the conversation with the following requirements:
1. Analyze your friend's mood and the intention of your friend.
2. Based on your friend's mood, select the best dialogue strategies.
3. Based on the strategy, generate the conversation that you expect to have.
Strategy pool:
1. questioning for details (What are you looking forward to?)
2. acknowledging or admitting. (That sounds like double good news.)
4. encouraging. (No worryies, I think you can definitely make it!)
5. sympathizing. (So sorry to hear that.)
6. suggesting. (maybe you two should go to the pet store and find a new pet!)
7. sharing own thoughts/opinion. (I would love to have a boy too, but Iâ€™m not sure if I want another one or not.)
8. sharing or relating to own experience. (I had a friend who went through the same thing.)
9. expressing care or concern. (I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle.)
10: disapproving. (But America is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening.)
11: rejection. (I will pass this time.)
